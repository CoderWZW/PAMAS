# PAMAS: Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent System with Perspective Aggregation for Misinformation Detection

## 🧩 Overview
**PAMAS** is a **Perspective-Aware Multi-Agent System** designed for robust and interpretable **misinformation detection**.  
It organizes agents hierarchically and aggregates diverse perspectives through a self-adaptive mechanism, effectively mitigating the *information-drowning problem* and enhancing both efficiency and robustness.

## 🚀 Features
- **Hierarchical Agent Architecture** – Auditors, Coordinators, and a Decision-Maker cooperate for perspective-aware reasoning.  
- **Self-Adaptive Mechanisms** – Structural adaptation, targeted refinement, and confidence-guided routing.  
- **Perspective Aggregation** – Integrates multi-view analysis to highlight anomaly cues and suppress redundant signals.  
- **Plug-and-Play Design** – Easily extendable to other reasoning or detection tasks.

## ▶️ How to run
python main.py

## 🧠 Notes
The dataset is **Amazon** (For Abnormal User Detection).
